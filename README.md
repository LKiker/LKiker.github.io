# Landrey Kiker – Graphics & VR Developer Portfolio

Welcome to my personal portfolio site built designed to showcase my work in graphics programming, shaders, and VR/AR development.

## About Me
I’m a **Computer Science graduate (Dec 2025)** from **West Texas A&M University**, passionate about **real-time rendering, shaders, and visual computing**.  
I build interactive experiences using Unity, Meta SDK, and C++, and I’m currently developing a **WebGL shader viewer** and **software rasterizer** to deepen my understanding of graphics pipelines.
